IN Saidapet Chennai Tamil Nadu, India has repeatedly faced severe flooding during intense northeast monsoon seasons. Prolonged heavy rainfall, combined with overflowing reservoirs such as Chembarambakkam Lake and the narrowing of natural waterways like the Adyar and Cooum rivers, has led to large-scale waterlogging. Roads were submerged, homes inundated, public transport disrupted, and thousands of residents displaced, highlighting the city’s ongoing struggle with urban drainage and rapid development.

Bengaluru has increasingly faced urban flooding due to intense rainfall, rapid urbanization, and the loss of interconnected lake systems. Flooding is commonly reported in areas such as Silk Board Junction, Koramangala, HSR Layout, Mahadevapura, Whitefield, Bellandur, and Marathahalli. Overflowing lakes like Bellandur and Varthur, along with clogged stormwater drains (raja kaluves), cause residential layouts, IT parks, and major roads to be submerged, leading to traffic paralysis, property damage, and disruptions to daily life.
